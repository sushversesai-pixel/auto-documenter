# Documentation for `parser.py`

## Class: `CodeParser`
### Method: `__init__`
```python
```python
"""Initializes a new SymbolTable instance.

Args:
    None.

Returns:
    None.  Initializes the SymbolTable with an empty symbol list,
    no current class, and an empty set of dependencies.
"""
```
```

### Method: `visit_Import`
```python
"""Visit an `ast.Import` node.

This method processes each `import X` statement encountered in the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
It extracts the top-level module name from each imported alias and adds it to the `dependencies` set.

Args:
    node: An `ast.Import` node representing an import statement in the Python code.

Returns:
    None.  This method modifies the `dependencies` set in place.
"""
```

### Method: `visit_ImportFrom`
```python
```python
"""Visit an ImportFrom node and add its module to the dependencies set.

This method is called for each 'from X import Y' statement encountered during AST traversal.  It extracts the top-level module name from the import statement and adds it to the `dependencies` set.  If a module is not specified (node.module is None), nothing is added.

Args:
    node (ast.ImportFrom): The ImportFrom AST node representing the 'from X import Y' statement.

Returns:
    None.  The method modifies the `dependencies` set in place.
"""
```
```

### Method: `visit_ClassDef`
```python
```python
"""Visits a ClassDef AST node and adds class information to the symbol table.

This method is called for each class definition encountered during AST traversal.
It extracts relevant information from the ClassDef node, such as the class name and its code block,
and appends a dictionary containing this information to the symbol table.  It also updates
the `current_class` attribute to track the currently visited class.

Args:
    node (ast.ClassDef): The ClassDef AST node being visited.

Returns:
    None.  The method modifies the symbol table in place.
"""
```
```

### Method: `visit_FunctionDef`
```python
"""Processes a function or method definition node in the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

Args:
    node: An instance of `ast.FunctionDef` representing the function or method definition in the AST.

Returns:
    None.  This method modifies the `self.symbols` list (for functions) or the `self.current_class['methods']` list (for methods) in place by adding a dictionary containing information about the function or method.  The dictionary has the following keys:
        - `type`:  String, either 'function' or 'method'.
        - `name`: String, the name of the function or method.
        - `args`: List of strings, the names of the arguments.
        - `return_type`: String, the return type of the function or method (or 'None' if not specified).
        - `code_block`: String, the code block of the function or method.
