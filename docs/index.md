# src: Python Module for Automated Documentation and Publication

This Python module, `src`, streamlines the process of generating comprehensive documentation and publication-ready materials for software projects.  It provides tools for automatically generating docstrings, module READMEs, architecture diagrams, and handles the publication of these assets, simplifying the often tedious task of maintaining up-to-date project documentation.  This facilitates better communication among developers, enhances code understanding, and makes sharing project information easier.

## Main Components:

* **`generate_docstring()`:**  Generates docstrings for Python functions and classes, adhering to a consistent style and including key information.
* **`generate_module_readme()`:** Creates a README file for a given module, automatically populating it with relevant information such as a module summary, a list of its components, and other useful details.
* **`generate_architecture_diagram()`:** Generates a visual representation of the software architecture, aiding in comprehension of the system's design and inter-component relationships.
* **`generate()`:** A high-level function orchestrating the generation of all documentation artifacts.
* **`publish()`:** Handles the deployment and publishing of the generated documentation to a chosen platform (e.g., GitHub Pages, a website).
* **`CodeParser`:** A class providing core functionality for parsing and analyzing Python code to extract metadata for documentation generation.


## Usage (Example):

```python
from src import generate

# Generate documentation for the current module
generate.generate() 

# Publish the generated documentation to GitHub pages
generate.publish(platform="github") # Other platforms could be supported in the future.
```
